# Skyline airline
Our website represents an airline company, called Skyline Air.
Anyone can search for flights, see details about them and reviews about the services of the company in general.
Making an account is possible as well. Having this, allows users to add reviews and modify/delete their own review and account and book flight tickets. They get a ticket generated and a confirmation
email after the reservation is completed. Each user is able to see the booked flights on her/his profile.
As an admin, an export to an Xcel document with all details about all users is accessible. Also, admins can see profiles of the users that posted reviews and they
can choose for each of them to make them admins or delete their account.
Extra:

-search for a flight by departure date on the home page (not checked by the teacher)
